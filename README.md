# Extractor
Extractor is a bash script that I made because I was tired to extract .tar files and creating desktop files for applications.
It is my first bash script and it can be improved a lot, so suggestions and critics are very welcome.
## Installation
At the moment you should just download the folder and add it to your path variable. I suggest doing it in the .bash_profile file.
## Usage
Call the script from your terminal:
```
extractor file_to_extract_name optional_destination_folder
```
## Roadmap
* Add --help command 
* Support multiple extensions
